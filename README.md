# HillClimbingVehicleRoutingProblem

The code was made for my Poznan Univerisity of Technology. It finds the optimal solution on the problem of Vehical Routing Problem.

# Code description
1. It reads input and check input is everything is okey and the code can find some solution.
2. Greedy algorithm makes first solution on our problem.
3. The code changes basic solution, optimize solution during 5 min.
4. After 5min we recive optimize soluion made by our algorithm.
